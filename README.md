# HumanActivityRecognitionProject
## Background
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.
In this project we aim to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. We will use the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

## Executive Summary
In this report, multiple models have been built based on differnt predictors and machine learning algorithm. With several cross-validation techniques, best model has been picked with out of sample error rate = 0.4%. The average test prediction error rate is less than 1% with 20 different test cases predictions.
